# perl-on-aws-app-runner
An example of running PSGI app on [AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/)

## Run the Basic Image

### Build the Basic Image

```console
git clone git@github.com:shogo82148/perl-on-aws-app-runner.git
cd perl-on-aws-app-runner/basic
docker build -t perl-basic-test .
```

### Push the Image to ECR

Open [ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry) service on AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories) and create a new ECR Repository.
And then, push the image to the repository.

```console
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-northeast-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
docker tag perl-basic-test:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/perl-basic-test:latest
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/perl-basic-test:latest
```

### Create a New Service on AWS App Runner

Open [AWS App Runner service on AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/home) and create a new service.

- Source:
    - **Repository type**: Container registry
    - **Provider**: Amazon ECR
    - **Container image URI**: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/perl-test:latest`
- Deployment settings:
    - **Deployment trigger**: Automatic
    - **ECR access role**: Create new service role (or "Use existing service role" if you have already created it)
- Service settings:
    - **Service name**: perl-basic-test
    - **Virtual CPU & memory**: 1vCPU & 2GB
    - **Environment variables**: None
    - **Port**: 5000
- Leave the other items as default

Wait for creating the service.
After that, you can see the "Hello world" message on https://xxxxxxxx.ap-northeast-1.awsapprunner.com/

### Run the Image with RDS

Here is an example of connecting to [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/).
It is a very simple access counter.

### Build the Basic Image

```console
git clone git@github.com:shogo82148/perl-on-aws-app-runner.git
cd perl-on-aws-app-runner/rds
docker build -t perl-rds-test .
```

### Push the Image to ECR

Open [ECR (Amazon Elastic Container Registry) service on AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories) and create a new ECR Repository.
And then, push the image to the repository.

```console
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-northeast-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com
docker tag perl-rds-test:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/perl-rds-test:latest
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/perl-rds-test:latest
```

### Create a New Amazon Aurora Cluster

Open [Amazon RDS on AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home) and create a new Amazon Aurora Cluster.
Password of the admin user will be autogenerated.
Make a note of it.
